    <p>
      This morning all the parts of me that haven't heard that you are away got me up and out early and longing to lie down beside you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Country had a special moment when your spirit reached me in leafy place and mad embrace. Would love to share with you if even pigtail. The trivia people may have tangents that you will luminesce if you get close enough, like dead (otherwise) tubes brought into electric atmosphere.
